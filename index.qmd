# Preface

These notes are split into four primary sections:

- [Chapter 2: The Basics of Stata](02-the-basics-of-stata.html) - Interacting
  with Stata.
- [Chapter 3: Working with Data Sets](03-working-with-data-sets.html) -
  Importing, opening, and saving data sets.
- [Chapter 4: Data Management](04-data-management.html) - The basics of
  maintaining and exploring a data set.
- [Chapter 5: Data Manipulation](05-data-manipulation.html) - Creating and
  modifying variables and other ways of manipulating your data.

These sections will generally be presented in sequence. The discussion will
alternate between theory and practice. The format will alternate between lecture
and exercises. Please ask questions as soon as they arise in your mind. Please
provide feedback or voice concerns.

There are two additional sections:

- [Chapter 6: Programming & Advanced Topics](06-programming.html) - Topics for
  users who wish to move beyond the basics.
- [Appendix](07-appendix.html) - Houses the exercise solutions.
