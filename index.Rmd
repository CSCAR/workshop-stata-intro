# Preface

## How to use this document

These notes are published in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) format
which enables easy creation of longform documents (using a mixture of
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), and for these notes specifically,
[Stata](http://www.stata.com/)'s
[dyndoc](http://www.stata.com/manuals/pdyndoc.pdf)).

The table of contents is found on the left hand side, with subsections expanding below the current section. At the top of the page are three icons, from left to right they 1) Hide/show the table of contents, 2) Search this document, and 3) Change the font the book is displayed in.

All images should link to full-size versions to see detail if needed.

Given that Stata 15 has been released relatively recently to this workshop (July 2017), while the workshop is designed with and taught towards Stata
15, we will flag areas where Stata 14 performs differently. Look for the following image to designate such areas:
