# Preface

These notes are split into four primary sections:

- [Chapter 2: The Basics of Stata](the-basics-of-stata.html) - Interacting with Stata.
- [Chapter 3: Working with Data Sets](working-with-data-sets.html) - Importing, opening, and saving data sets.
- [Chapter 4: Data Management](data-management.html) - The basics of maintaining and exploring a data set.
- [Chapter 5: Data Manipulation](data-manipulation.html) - Creating and modifying variables and other ways of manipulating your data.

These sections will generally be presented in sequence. The discussion will alternate between theory and practice. The format will alternate between
lecture and exercises. Please ask questions as soon as they arise in your mind. Please provide feedback or voice concerns.

There are two additional sections:

- [Chapter 6: Programming & Advanced Topics](programming-advanced-features.html) - Topics for users who wish to move beyond the basics.
- [Appendix](appendix.html) - Houses the exercise solutions.
